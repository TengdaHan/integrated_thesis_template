% ######## YOU NEED TO EDIT THE FOLLOWING ########

% add prefix to all the \label and \ref
% import the main tex file from paper directory (e.g. from arxiv)
{\clearpage

% after changing the prefix, we need to redefine the \ref and \label
\def\currentprefix{paper1:}
\renewcommand*{\ref}[1]{\fixedref{\currentprefix:#1}}
\renewcommand*{\label}[1]{\fixedlabel{\currentprefix:#1}}

% redefine the \input and \includegraphics to give the correct path
\renewcommand*{\input}[1]{\fixedinput{chapter/paper1/#1}}
\renewcommand*{\includegraphics}[2][]{\fixedincludegraphics[#1]{chapter/paper1/#2}}

% import the main tex file from paper directory (e.g. from arxiv)   
\fixedinput{chapter/paper1/main.tex}

% restore the original \input and \includegraphics
\renewcommand*{\input}[1]{\fixedinput{#1}}
\renewcommand*{\includegraphics}[2][]{\fixedincludegraphics[#1]{#2}}
}
